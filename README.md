## 📚 Concepts & Techniques

- **[Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)** – Seminal paper introducing the Transformer architecture, which underpins nearly all modern LLMs.
- **[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol)** – A proposed standard for structuring context sent to LLMs to improve clarity and functionality.
- **[Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/)** – A technique for improving LLMs by allowing them to retrieve relevant documents at inference time.
- **[Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/reinforcement-learning-from-human-feedback/)** – Training method where models learn preferred behavior using rankings from human annotators.
